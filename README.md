# Programming II (Java)

---

The main objective of the course is to train students in problem solving through object-oriented programming (OOP). Throughout the course, students will learn to apply advanced modular programming techniques, to reuse code through libraries and frameworks, and to develop complex solutions through debugging and logical reasoning processes.

In addition, the course aims for students to acquire additional competencies in key areas such as developing applications with graphical user interfaces using JavaFX, implementing recognized design patterns such as Factory and MVC, and managing persistence and database connection in their applications. These skills will enable students to create robust and efficient software, aligned with the needs of the work environment.

### Subject Learning Results (RAC)

At the end of the course the student will be able to:

**RAC1**. Solve problems by applying object-oriented programming.

**RAC2**. Apply modular programming techniques and code reuse, using libraries and frameworks.

**RAC3**. Develop step-by-step solutions applying debugging techniques and logical reasoning to solve complex programming problems.

For all periods the grade is divided into: Co-evaluation (10 %), self-evaluation (10 %), and teacher evaluation (80 %) which is divided into exams (30 %) and assignments (50 %). The first and second periods are 35 % of the final grade, while for the last period it is 30 %. In the first and second periods the exam consists of two tests: one practical (60 %) and the other theoretical (40 %). 

The project is divide in two grades: first (20 %) and last (80 %) assignment delivery.

**Note:** You can practice and complement the course by solving programming problems in any of the following pages:

- [Codeabbey](https://www.codeabbey.com/)
- [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

Each problem solved, that pass all the test created for the page, can be change by points. Very simple problems are not valid.

## Assigments

All assignments will be stored on [GitHub](https://github.com/) but will be uploaded for grading on [Campus Virtual](https://campusvirtualpes.etitc.edu.co/Edusuperior/). To learn more about GitHub commands and concepts here are some tutorials:
